This directory contains a collection of BibTeX style files for various
physics journals due to Charles Karney (Karney@Princeton.EDU). The
compilation of this archive and some extensions to the physj* files were
done by Hans-Hermann Bode (HHBODE@DOSUNI1.BITNET).

Herein are the following files:

./README	this file
./physics.btx	master file for creating the bst files
./physjful.btx	full journal names, to be included in physics.btx
./physjabb.btx	abbreviated journal names, to be included in physics.btx
./physjful.bib	full journal names, for use with other BibTeX styles
./physjabb.bib	abbreviated journal names, for use with other BibTeX styles
./cpp.el	preprocessor for GNU-Emacs to generate the bst files from
		physics.btx
./aip.bst	BibTeX style for American Institute of Physics journals
./aip.sty	associated LaTeX document style
./cpc.bst	BibTeX style for Computer Physics Communications
./iaea.bst	BibTeX style for IAEA conferences
./jcp.bst	BibTeX style for the Journal of Computational Physics
./nf.bst	BibTeX style for Nuclear Fusion
./nf.sty	associated LaTeX document style
./nflet.bst	BibTeX style for Nuclear Fusion Letters
./pf.bst	BibTeX style for Physics of Fluids
./ppcf.bst	a physics version of the apalike BibTeX style
./report.bst	BibTeX style for internal reports
./rmp.bst	BibTeX style for Reviews of Modern Physics

To use the styles, copy all *.bst files needed into a directory where BibTeX
looks for style files. This will usually be a directory in the TEXINPUT(S)
path, i.e., in the same path where TeX looks for its input files.

In addition, if appropriate, copy the *.sty files into a directory where TeX
looks for its input files, see above.

For use of the physj*.bib files with other BibTeX styles, copy them into a
directory where BibTeX looks for bibliography databases. This will usually
be a directory in the BIBINPUT(S) path.

If you want to re-generate the *.bst files from physics.btx, change the line

#include "physics-journal-abbrev.btx"

to include one of the physj*.btx files.
